                <p>I took this photo photo to capture an intimate moment of the celebration, focusing on the simple details rather than a grand party. The overhead perspective flattens the scene, using the negative space on the plate to emphasize the handwritten "Happy Birthday" message abd the single scoop of gelato. The dim, moody lighting creates a warm, personal atmosphere, highlighting q quiet joy.</p>

                <p>As night wraps the world in softening sounds and slowing time. I was alone sitting on a bench trying to see stars in the night sky, but what I first noticed was these street lamps. Fascinating. It felt like when darkness refuses to speak, light rises forming a quiet triangle of watchful glow.
Together they hold the night in balance, as if the dark itself depends on their agreement.</p>

                <p>I took this photo to show the calm and openness of the national museum environment. The large negative space created by the sky and field makes the scene feel quiet and peaceful. The balanced structure of the building adds stability, while the clouds soften the mood. Overall, the image reflects a calm and grounded atmosphere within the national museum.</p>

                <p> I took this shot to capture the contrast between the bold, modern architecture and the soft, lush tropical garden setting. The image highlights how structured design and natural elements can coexist in harmony. The calm surroundings and open space create a feeling of quiet, private elegance.</p>

                <p>As night wraps the world in softening sounds and slowing time. I was alone sitting on a bench trying to see stars in the night sky, but what I first noticed was these street lamps. Fascinating. It felt like when darkness refuses to speak, light rises forming a quiet triangle of watchful glow.
Together they hold the night in balance, as if the dark itself depends on their agreement.</p>

                <p class="composition-tech"><em>Leading Lines</em></p>
                <p>The photo is about a journey to a sacred or historic place. The long, straight path functions as the "story's journey." It is a deliberate walk, and not just a casual stroll.

                <p>This photo captures the peaceful atmosphere of people watching the sunset together. The sea, shore, and sky create depth across the image.

                <p class="composition-tech"><em>Leading Lines, Rule of Thirds</em></p>
                <p>It looks like a normal tourist spot in Batan Island (One of the 3 main Islands in Batanes), but it's actually a formation of two large rocks split down the middle creating a passageway, and becomes part of the island's coastal road. Now that is the reason why it is called "Alapad Rock Formation".</p>

                <p class="composition-tech"><em>Leading Lines, Depth</em></p>
                <p>This photo because the long hallway naturally guides the viewer’s eyes forward through the exhibits. The repeating frames and lights create strong leading lines that emphasize depth and continuity. The empty floor and walls provide negative space, making the artwork stand out more clearly. Overall, the image shows how history feels like a journey you walk through, not just something you look at.</p>

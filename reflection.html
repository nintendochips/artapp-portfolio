            Before this project, we mostly thought of photography as a way that only take pictures or record things. Now, we recognize it fully as an art form defined by willful choices. We also learned that a photographer is not just an observer, but also an author casting visual statement, as well as giving ordinary subjects weight and meaning through light and frame. This newfound appreciation directly impacted the way we see the world. It changed how we see everyday spaces and moments from simple background noise into potential narratives. Walking down a familiar street, we no longer just saw a wall, we can now see the texture of peeling paint, the harsh shadow line or the leading lines of a staircase, along with the elements that could transform a typical spot into a captivating visual story. This constant search for the frame has made us more present and observant. In terms of craft, the most impactful element for improving our visual storytelling was definitely the application of the rule of thirds and leading lines. While we knew the concepts, consciously using the rule of thirds forced us to move subjects away from the dead center, straight away adding tension and dynamism. Incorporating leading lines, whether roads, railings, or even glances, gave our photos a clear path for the viewer’s eye, making our intended message much clearer and more immersive. Finally, collaborating as a group influenced our creative decisions by forcing us out of our comfort zones. Each of us had a style that we liked. Stark minimalism for one, bright colour for another, and candid moments for a third. Compromises reached during the discussion of these various visions produced images that were more intricate and multi-layered than any one of us could have created on our own. As a result of our group critique sessions, our final portfolio becomes coherent, which served as a filter that honed our best ideas and eliminated our worst.
